# Description

The file `suru-plus-folders` is a bash script that allows changing the color of folders in [Suru++ 25 icons](https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus) and [Suru++ Ubuntu icons](https://github.com/Bonandry/suru-plus-ubuntu) themes, based on the forks of icons of folders of Papirus.

# Changing the colour of folders

Some examples of use:

- Showing the current color and available colors for Suru++ 25 or Suru++ Ubuntu:
  ```sh
  # Suru++ 25
  suru-plus-folders -l --theme Suru++
  # Suru++ Ubuntu
  suru-plus-folders -l --theme Suru++-Ubuntu
  ```
- Changing colour of folders to brown for Suru++ 25 or Suru++ Ubuntu:
  ```sh
  # Suru++ 25
  suru-plus-folders -C brown --theme Suru++
  # Suru++ Ubuntu
  suru-plus-folders -l --theme Suru++-Ubuntu
  ```
- Revert to default color of folders for places of Suru++ 25 or Suru++ Ubuntu:
  ```sh
  # Suru++ 25
  suru-plus-folders -D --theme Suru++
  # Suru++ Ubuntu
  suru-plus-folders -l --theme Suru++-Ubuntu
  ```
- Restore the last used color from a config file:
  ```sh
  suru-plus-folders -Ru
  ```

## Important advice!

This is extremely useful for restoring colour after each icons theme upgrade (official installers of [Suru++](https://github.com/gusbemacbe/suru-plus) and some third-party packages do this automatically).

**NOTE:** To change the colour of an individual folder you can use [Folder Color](http://foldercolor.tuxfamily.org) or [Dolphin Folder Color](https://github.com/audoban/dolphin-folder-color).
